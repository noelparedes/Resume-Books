## Begin Reading

1. Do you spend to much time learning with disappointing results?
2. Do you find it difficult to remember what you read?
3. Do you put off studying because it's boring and you're easily distracted?

Building on insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, we will give you a crash course to improve your ability to learn, whether you’re studying math, language, coding, karate, cooking, or anything else.

Through their decades of writing, teaching, and research on learning, Olav and Barb have developed deep connections with experts from a vast array of disciplines. What you’ll find in this little
book are the very best of practical learning tools and insights synthesized from research in neuroscience, cognitive psychology,education, and many other fields.

## How to Focus Intently and Beat Procrastination

### The Pomodoro Technique
  
  - Use this approach to structure your study sessions:

  1. **Sit down where you’ll be studying or working and remove any possible distractors.** This means ensuring there are no pop-ups or extraneous open tabs on your computer, dings from your cell phone, or anything else that could draw you off-task.

  2. **Set a timer for 25 minutes.** You can use a mechanical or silent digital timer. You can also use the timer or an app on your phone. If you use your phone, place it out of sight and beyond arm’s reach so you won’t be distracted while focusing.

  3. **Dive in and study or work as intently as you can for those 25 minutes.** If your mind wanders (as it inevitably will), just bring your attention back to the task at hand. Most things can wait or be postponed for 25 minutes. If distracting thoughts come up that you feel like you should act on, write them down in a to-do list so you can tackle them after the Pomodoro session is over. 

  4. **Reward yourself** for about 5 minutes at the end of the Pomodoro session. Listen to your favorite song, close your
     eyes and relax, go for a walk, make a cup of tea, cuddle with your dog or cat—anything to let your mind comfortably flow free. It’s also best to avoid checking your cell phone or email during this break time—more on why later.

  5. **Repeat as appropriate.** If you want to study for 2 hours, you can do four Pomodoros with the break lasting roughly 5 minutes each time. If you have trouble getting yourself back to work when the break is done, set a timer for the break as well.

  The Pomodoro technique in four easy steps. 

  ### Why the Pomodoro Technique Works
 
 You might wonder how something so simple can be so powerful. The reason is that the Pomodoro Technique captures important aspects
of how your brain learns.
  
  * Pomodoro-fueled bursts of focused attention give your brain practice in focusing without disruption. 
  * Short mental breaks where you get away from focusing are ideal to allow you to transfer what you've just learned into long-term memory, clearing your mind for new learning.
  * Anticipation of a reward keeps you motivated throughout the Pomodoro.
  * It's much easier to commit and recommit yourself to short bursts of dedicated study than to seemingly endless sessions.
  * Your studies begin a pattern of focusing on the _process_ putting in certain amounts of dedicated time rather than the _goal_ or _outcome_.
  
   Note:_In the long run, having a good process in place is much more important than any one individual session or goal.
  * When you even just think about something you don’t like or don’t want to do, it activates the insular cortex, causing a “pain in the brain.” This pain diminishes after about 20 minutes of focus on the activity.

### Avoid Your Mobile Phone During Learning breaks

Research by professors Sanghoon Kang and Terri Kurtzberg from Rutgers Business School has revealed that *using a mobile phone for a break does not allow your brain to recharge as effectively as the other types of breaks.*

*Mobile phones are also particularly distracting if you happen to be in face-to-face training of classes*. One study found that _Students who were not using their mobile phones wrote down 62% more information in their notes  where able to recall more detailed information from the lecture, and scored a full letter grade and a half higher on a multiple choice test than students who actively used their mobile phones. Even just having your phone near you while you're studying can be distracting your brain is still tracking it if it knows it's close at hand.
If you feel anxious without a phone, researchers have found you'll still be better of with the phone out of reach. Leave your phone in a backpack, briefcase, or purse, or even back in the car. You'll be shocked at how mucho your focus improves. 

### Be Wary of Multitasking When Studying

Multitasking while you are studying it is not good the reason of that it is because whenever you switch your focus to a new task, you activate information stored in you brain related to the new task. When you switch to a different task we activate a different set of information. This leave you what's call and __attention residue__ some leftover attention from your previous task that means your attention isn't fully on the new task. 

Frequently this increase susceptibility to distraction, causes more errors, slows work, make writing worses, diminishes learning, and causes forgetting. __In short, bad news. One study by researchers at the University of Michigan found that cognitive performance fell by 30-40 percent when participants switched between tasks instead of completing on task before moving to the next. 

### Set Up a Distraction-Free Environment
Some time it might be a little bit difficult but you have to find a place where you can study without any distractions. 

Recommendation
1- Avoid study in rooms where your friends or colleagues socialize. 
2- A quiet library or isolated location can be ideal. 
3- Avoid your cellphone notifications from computer and phone. 

__Create a Ready-Resume Plan When an Unavoidable Interruption Comes up__

_ Take a few seconds to mentally note where you are in your current task, and how you'll return to the task. 

__Take Frequent Brief Breaks__

- Taking mental break will help you to offload the new material into de long-term memory.
- Breaks tha involve something Physical, like going for a walk or jog, are always a good Idea. 
- Another reason is tha movement and exercise themselves are helpful for the learning process. 

__Music and Binaural Beats__

Studying to music may you feel that you can study longer, but because while you listen music, part of your attention is
following the turn so you aren't working as has you could be. If you are getting good grades or evaluations for what you're
learning, you're probably fine to listen to music. But if your feedback isn't what you would like, or you're struggling to make
headway with the material, we'd suggest backing away from music. 


**KEY TAKEAWAYS** 
FROM THE CHAPTER

**The Pomodoro Technique is one of the most powerful methods for tackling procrastination. To do it:**

– Remove distractions.
– Set a timer for 25 minutes.
– Focus as intently as you can for those 25 minutes.
– Reward yourself. Take a 5-minute or so mental break. (Use a timer for the break if necessary.)
– Do another Pomodoro until the work—or you!—is done.

**A pain in the brain can trigger procrastination.** 

Be aware of minor feelings of discomfort when you think about something you don’t like to do—these feelings can trigger procrastination.
That pain in the brain dissipates once you get started.

**In general, it’s best to avoid multitasking.**
 
 But multitasking is not all bad—it can sometimes help you avoid becoming fixed on a cognitive approach that’s going nowhere.

**Set up a distraction-free environment.**

 Do a sweep through the notifications settings on your devices and disable audible, visible, and vibrating alerts. Keep your phone out of reach.

**If you are called off-task by someone or something, try to take mental note of where you were so you can more easily return to it.**

**Take frequent brief breaks.**
 
 If you go too long on any one task, you will inevitably tire.**

**If you like to listen to music when you’re working, make sure it isn’t distracting your attention.** 
 
 Think twice about listening to music while studying unless you’re already learning the material well.
