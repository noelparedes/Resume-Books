# Begin Reading

1. Do you spend to much time learning with disappointing results?
2. Do you find it difficult to remember what you read?
3. Do you put off studying because it's boring and you're easily distracted?

Building on insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, we will give you a crash course to improve your ability to learn, whether you’re studying math, language, coding, karate, cooking, or anything else.

Through their decades of writing, teaching, and research on learning, Olav and Barb have developed deep connections with experts from a vast array of disciplines. What you’ll find in this little
book are the very best of practical learning tools and insights synthesized from research in neuroscience, cognitive psychology,education, and many other fields.

# How to Focus Intently and Beat Procrastination

**KEY TAKEAWAYS** 

FROM THE CHAPTER

**The Pomodoro Technique is one of the most powerful methods for tackling procrastination. To do it:**

– Remove distractions.
– Set a timer for 25 minutes.
– Focus as intently as you can for those 25 minutes.
– Reward yourself. Take a 5-minute or so mental break. (Use a timer for the break if necessary.)
– Do another Pomodoro until the work—or you!—is done.

**A pain in the brain can trigger procrastination.** 

Be aware of minor feelings of discomfort when you think about something you don’t like to do—these feelings can trigger procrastination.
That pain in the brain dissipates once you get started.

**In general, it’s best to avoid multitasking.**
 
 But multitasking is not all bad—it can sometimes help you avoid becoming fixed on a cognitive approach that’s going nowhere.

**Set up a distraction-free environment.**

 Do a sweep through the notifications settings on your devices and disable audible, visible, and vibrating alerts. Keep your phone out of reach.

**If you are called off-task by someone or something, try to take mental note of where you were so you can more easily return to it.**

**Take frequent brief breaks.**
 
 If you go too long on any one task, you will inevitably tire.**

**If you like to listen to music when you’re working, make sure it isn’t distracting your attention.** 
 
 Think twice about listening to music while studying unless you’re already learning the material well.

# How to Overcome Being Stuck

**KEY TAKEAWAYS** 

FROM THE CHAPTER

In this chapter you going to find a few tips that going to help you to overcome being stuck while you are studying. 

The Author point out at the beginning to mode that can help you.

**Focused Mode** helps you work through familiar problems, to load difficult material into your brain so the diffuse mode can begin
processing it.

**Diffuse Mode** helps you make sense of new challenges in whatever you're learning, whether it's understanding a new accounting concept, handling a challenging search engine optimization problem, or figuring out how to put in windy conditions in golf. 

**Learning often involves moving back and forth between focused and diffuse modes.** It's typical to get stuck when learning something difficult that just means it's time to move from focused to diffuse mode. Take a break, o work on something different, to let neural processing continue in the background. 

**Use the Hard Start Technique.** This means to begin with the hardest problems on the tests or homework. Pause the hard problem when you get stuck so that you can work on another problem. Return the hard problem after a while. 

**Do not edit when you're writing the first draft of a report or essay.** A good way to avoid editing is to cover or turn off your computer screen so you can't see what you're writing 


# How to Learn Anything Deeply

**KEY TAKEAWAYS** 

FROM THE CHAPTER

**-Learning means connecting neurons in your brain. To make learning deep and lasting, you have to make those connections strong.**

**-Actively engage with the material to jump-start those neural connections, using retrieval practice whenever is possible**:
 - Work problems yourself avoid looking at the solutions
 - Test yourself 
 - Try to recall main ideas from a text.
 - Explain key concepts in simple ways to yourself, or to someone else.
 - Work with another person or small group of that is as interested as you are in the material. 
 - Create study materials flash cards, study guides, anything that require you to process the information and put it into a new format.
 **-Break up your learning int several shorter sessions over several days, instead of one ultra long session.**

 **Challenge yourself to progress faster**.  When learning becomes easy, increase the level of difficulty.

 **To learn difficult concept well, you need to actively connect what you're learning to other material you're learning or already know.** You can do this through elaboration or interleaving. 

 **Don't procrastinate when you're trying to learn it takes may days to build the solid neural architecture of good learning.**

 **Exercise regularly.** Exercise has been shown to help you more easily form neural connections.

 **Cautions use of cognitive enhancements such as coffee or tea, along with a healthy diet, can improve your ability to learn.**

 **Regularly get enough sleep**. Sleep is when your neural architecture grows. Spacing out your learning over several days will give more sleep periods, which will strengthen your learning. 

 # How to Maximize Working Memory and Take Better Notes

**KEY TAKEAWAYS** 
FROM THE CHAPTER
- **Working memory is oly a temporary holding place for thoughts and information.** When you put something in working memory, it can seem as if you've truly learned it. But learning only happens when you secure the idea, concept, or technique in long-term memory. 

- **You can typically hold perhaps four pieces of information in your mind at once,** because your working memory has only a few "arms."

- **You can compensate for the small size of your working memory by building sets of links in long-term memory.**

- **You can compensate for the small size of your working memory by building sets of links in long-term memory.**

- **To make the best use of your limited working memory:**

 - Break material into chunks.
 - Translate what you're leaning into more understandable terms.
 - Make a task list to clear your working memory. 
 - Put ideas on paper to extend your working memory.

- **To take good notes:**
 - Use the split notes system or make a concept map.
 - Do a first-time review of your notes the same day you take them.
 - Make sure you actively practice with and try to recall the key ideas of the notes.
