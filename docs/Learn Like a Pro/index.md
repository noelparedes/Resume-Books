## Preface

### What are some reason  to rewrite the book for the present generation of reader?

 The reason for doing so lie in changes that have taken place both in our society in the las thirty year.
 1- Today many more of the young men and women  who complete high school enter and complete for year of college
 2- A much larger proportion of the population has become literate in spite of or even because of the popularity of radio and television.

### What have captivated the adults?

Adults in large numbers have been captivated by the glittering promises made by speed-reading courses that promise to increase their comprehension of what they read as well as their speed in reading it. 

## Things that have not changes 

1- Archive all the purpose of reading, the desideratum(desired) mus bee the ability to read different things at different-appropriate-speeds, not everything at the greatest possible speed. Pascal observed "When we read to fast or to slowly, we understand nothing".
2-Another thing that have not changed,unfortunately, is the failure to carry instruction in reading beyond the elementary level.
 
 **_Note_:** _James Mursell of Columbia University's wrote an article for the atlantic Monthly entitled **"The Failure of the Schools"**_

## Do pupils in school learn to read their mother tongue effectively? Yes or no.
   Up to the fifth grade ans sixth grade, reading, on the whole, is effectively taught and well learned. To that level we find a steady and general improvement, but beyond it the curves flatten out to a dead level.

## Part 1 The Dimensions of Reading
 ### The Activity and Art of Reading 

 **Who is this book for?**
  It is for readers and those who wish to become readers. Particularly, it is for readers of books. Even more particularly, it is for those whose main purpose in reading book is to gain increased understanding. 
   
 **It is necessary the reading nowadays? Why yes or no?**  
  It might seen that is not necessary with all the information that we have in the media, radio, television, and today youtube etc, where people use the ingenious of the rhetoric and select data ans statics to make it easy for him to "make up his own mind" with the minimum of difficulty and effort. But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. 
  
  Instead, he insert a packaged opinion into his min, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and "plays back" the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.

 ### Active Reading

  **Where you can apply this rules**
  
  These rule can be applied in printed material in general to any type of reading matter, to newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, articles, tracts, even advertisements.  

  Many people might think that reading is passive but that is not true at all since you can not read with our eyes immobilized and our minds asleep. That being said one reader can be more or less active, to point out that the more active the reading the better. One reader is better than another in proportion as he is capable of greater range of activity in reading and exerts more effort. 

  Both the writer and the speaker must put out some effort, it is much more like the catcher in a game of baseball. Catching the ball is just as much an activity as pitching or hitting it. The Thing that is written and read, like the ball, is the passive object common to the two activities that begin and terminate the process. 

  We can take this analogy a step further. The art of catching is the skill of catching every kind of pitch fast balls and curves, change ups and knucklers. Similarly, the art of reading is the skill of catching every sort of communication as well as possible. 
  
  It is noteworthy that the pitcher and catcher are successful only to the extent that they cooperate. The relation of writer and reader is similar.  The writer isn't trying not to be caught, although is sometimes seems so. Successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to have received finds its way into the reader's possession. The writer's skill and the reader's skill converge upon a common end. 

  There is one respect in which the analogy breaks down. The ball is a simple unit. It is either completely caught or not. A piece of writing, however, is a complex object. It can be received more or less completely, all the way from very little of what the writer intent the whole of it.  The amount the reader "catches" will usually depend on the amount of activity he put into the process, as well as upon the skill with which he executes the different mental acts involved. 

  **The Goals of Reading: Reading for Information and Reading for Understanding**

  There is the book; and here is your mind. As you go through the pages, either you understand perfectly everything the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained information, but you could not have increased your understanding. If the book is completely intelligible to you from start to finish.

  What to do when you the book perfectly?

  You can take the book to someone else who, you think, can read better than you, and have him explain the parts that trouble you. He may be a live person or another book-a commentary or text book.
