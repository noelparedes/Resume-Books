Resume books
</h1>

A collection of some resume books I have read lately. I hope this collection can help someone and if you have some advice let me know<a href="https://noelparedes.github.io/Resume-Books/"> Have a look of them here.</a>

This is a collection of some of the books I read.

Lately, I have been immerse in the habit of reading, one of the thing that I have learnt from the books is that I have to keep a place where I can put my note and thought about the books and thing I have learnt. On my journey to become a developer I found someone whom this page and resume books is inspired and I going to leave a link to his github repo down below is going to be really helpful for you too. He repo is more about of his favorite sentences from the books.

I Think this project could help someone if I share it with my friend and if you think this project can help someone you can share with them too. I'm going to do my best to update every week with a least one book I read.
