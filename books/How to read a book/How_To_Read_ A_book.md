## Preface

### What are some reason  to rewrite the book for the present generation of reader?

 The reason for doing so lie in changes tha have taken place both in our society in the las thirty year.
 1- Today many more of the young men and women  who complete high school enter and complete for year of college
 2- A much larger proportion of the population has become literate in spite of or even because of the popularity of radio and television.

### What have captivated the adults?

Adults in large numbers have been captivated by the glittering promises made by speed-reading courses that promise to increase their comprehension of what they read as well as their speed in reading it. 

## Things that have not changes 

1- Archive all the purpose of reading, the desideratum(desired) mus bee the ability to read different things at different-appropriate-speeds, not everything at the greatest possible speed. Pascal observed "When we read to fast or to slowly, we understand nothing".
2-Another thing that have not changed,unfortunately, is the failure to carry instruction in reading beyond the elementary level.
 
 **_Note_:** _James Mursell of Columbia University's wrote an article for the atlantic Monthly entitled **"The Failure of the Schools"**_

## Do pupils in school learn to read their mother tongue effectively? Yes or no.
   Up to the fifth grade ans sixth grade, reading, on the whole, is effectively taught and well learned. To that level we find a steady and general improvement, but beyond it the curves flatten out to a dead level.
